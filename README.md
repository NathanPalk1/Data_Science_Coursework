# Data Science Coursework

This code was written to analyse data on a collection of 74 _S. aureus_ isolates from Laabei et al. (2015). The aim of this analysis was to identify if cytotoxicity demosntrates the same relationship with disease severity in human infections as it does with animal models. 

To run:
  1. Download all of the scripts in this repository as well as the datasets needed        for analysis (isolate_data.csv for initial analysis, isolate_data2.csv for K        nearest neighbours analysis, and dummy_isolate_data.csv for predictions on the      model created).
  2. Run through the code which takes you through intial exploration with seaborn,        linear regression models and K nearest neighbour modelling.
  3. If using a different data set, edit the filenames and match the format. For K        nearest neighbour analysis, convert any categories to binary format as done in      this analysis.
